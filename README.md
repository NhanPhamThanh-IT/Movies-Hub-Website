## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  

Before getting started, ensure that your system has all the necessary tools and libraries installed for smooth project execution. Below are the key requirements:  

#### **Main Requirements**  

- **Node.js** (>=14.0.0): This is a JavaScript runtime environment required to build and run the application. You can check your installed version using the command:  
  ```sh
  node -v
  ```  
  If not installed, download and install it from the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).  

- **npm** (>=6.0.0) or **yarn** (>=1.22.0): These are package managers used to install the necessary dependencies for the project.  
  - Check the npm version:  
    ```sh
    npm -v
    ```  
  - Or check the yarn version (if using yarn):  
    ```sh
    yarn -v
    ```  
  If not installed, npm comes with Node.js, or you can install Yarn using:  
  ```sh
  npm install -g yarn
  ```  

#### **Supporting Dependencies**  

- **API Backend**: This project requires a backend API to fetch data. In this case, we use an online API from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). You need to register an account and obtain an API Key to use it in the project.  

  **Steps to get an API Key:**  
  1. Sign up for an account at [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup).  
  2. Go to the [TMDb API Section](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and generate an API Key.  
  3. Save the API Key and add it to your project configuration file (e.g., `.env` or directly in the source code).  

#### **Optional but Recommended**  

In addition to the mandatory requirements above, consider using the following tools for better workflow:  

- ![Git Logo](https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Icon-1788C.svg) **Git**: A version control system to track changes in your source code.  
- ![VS Code Logo](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/images/code-stable.png) **VS Code** (or a similar IDE): A powerful code editor for project development.  
- **Postman**: A useful tool to test API requests and responses before integrating them into the application.   

Once you have all the prerequisites installed, you can proceed with setting up and running the project. ðŸš€

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`
Serves the production build from the `dist` folder.
